Asset setup for conversion from StorSimple to Azure Blob format
===============================================================

            

This script helps set up assets for the script that will convert from StorSimple to Azure Blob format. If you use this, only 2 assets will have to be added manually -- the AzureCredential and the VMCredential. All other assets will be added by running this
 script as a runbook in Azure Automation. Some of the assets that are added by this script include target storage account, source volumes, file patterns, directory pattern etc.

 

 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
